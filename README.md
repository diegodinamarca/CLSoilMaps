# CLSoilMaps
CLSoilMaps is a database of maps of soil physical and hydraulic properties for Chile. This is and on going project for creating maps of soil properties using
digital soil mapping techniques.

Soil Maps were produced using a Random Forest Model trained with more than 4000 soil observations. Soil hydraulic properties were modelled using pedotransfer functions. 
All soil properties were predicted at six standards depths: 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100, 100-200 cm following GlobalSoilMaps project specifications.
The resulting maps have a resolution of 0.01Â° (near 100m).
